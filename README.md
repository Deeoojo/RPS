<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script brings the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game to life, allowing two opponents to engage in a battle of wits. Players take turns entering their choices, and the winner is determined by the traditional rules of the game. The code features input validation to ensure a smooth and error-free gaming experience. This project is not only a fun implementation of the game but also serves as a great example of user input handling and conditional logic in Python.
